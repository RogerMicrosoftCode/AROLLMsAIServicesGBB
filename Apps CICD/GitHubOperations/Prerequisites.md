# Prerequisites
- An OpenShift Container Platform (OSE) account
- A GitHub repository containing your application code

## Step 1: Set up your OpenShift project
Make sure you have a project set up in OpenShift where you want to deploy your microservice. Take note of the project name and the access token that you'll need for authentication.

## Step 2: Create a new GitHub repository
Create a new GitHub repository where you'll store your microservice code and the deployment configuration.

## Step 3: Creating a GitHub Action Workflow
Now, let's create the GitHub Action workflow that will trigger the deployment process. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Actions" tab.
2. Click on the "Set up a workflow yourself" button or choose an existing workflow file to edit.
3. Create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy-to-ose.yml`) or edit the existing one.
4. Define the workflow using YAML syntax. Here's a basic template to get started:

```yaml
name: Deploy to OpenShift

env:
  OPENSHIFT_SERVER: ${{ secrets.OPENSHIFT_SERVER }}
  OPENSHIFT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OPENSHIFT_TOKEN }}
  OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE: "your-project-name"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to OpenShift
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install OpenShift CLI
        uses: redhat-actions/openshift-tools-installer@v1
        with:
          oc: 4

      - name: Log in to OpenShift
        uses: redhat-actions/oc-login@v1
        with:
          openshift_server_url: ${{ env.OPENSHIFT_SERVER }}
          openshift_token: ${{ env.OPENSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          insecure_skip_tls_verify: true
          namespace: ${{ env.OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE }}

      - name: Deploy application
        run: |
          # Add your deployment commands here
          oc apply -f deployment/
```
