# Testing Your GitHub Actions Workflow for OpenShift

## Local Testing Before Automation

- Ensure you can execute `oc` commands manually from your terminal
- Verify your deployment configuration files work correctly when applied manually
- Confirm your OpenShift token has the necessary permissions

## Incremental Workflow Testing

1. Start with a minimal workflow that only checks out your code
2. Add steps gradually to identify potential issues
3. Test each component in isolation before combining them

## Use Testing Environments

- Configure your initial deployments to development or testing environments
- Avoid testing directly in production until you've verified everything works
- Create a separate namespace in OpenShift specifically for CI/CD testing

## Manual Workflow Triggering

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select your workflow from the left sidebar
3. Click the "Run workflow" button
4. Choose the branch you want to run the workflow against
5. Click "Run workflow" to start the execution

## Review Detailed Logs

- After execution, examine the logs for each workflow step
- Look for error messages or warnings
- GitHub Actions provides comprehensive logs that can help identify issues
- Pay special attention to the OpenShift authentication and deployment steps

## Verify Deployment in OpenShift

1. Log in to your OpenShift Web Console after the workflow completes
2. Navigate to your project
3. Check that resources were correctly created/updated
4. Verify pods are running without errors
5. Test that your application functions as expected
6. Check routes/services are correctly configured

## Test with Minor Changes

1. Make a small change to your application code or configuration
2. Commit and push the change to trigger the workflow
3. Verify the change is properly reflected in OpenShift
4. Check deployment timestamps to confirm the update occurred

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems
- Verify GitHub Secrets are correctly configured
- Ensure the OpenShift token hasn't expired
- Check for typos in server URLs or token values

### Permission Issues
- Confirm your token has appropriate roles assigned in OpenShift
- Check that the namespace exists and is accessible
- Verify resource quotas aren't preventing deployments

### Configuration Errors
- Ensure directory paths in your workflow match your repository structure
- Validate all YAML files with a linter before committing
- Check that environment variables are being passed correctly

### Deployment Failures
- Verify image pull secrets if using private registries
- Check resource constraints (CPU/memory limits)
- Examine pod events in OpenShift for detailed error information

## Next Steps After Successful Testing

1. Implement more advanced features in your workflow
2. Set up notifications for successful/failed deployments
3. Add quality gates like automated testing before deployment
4. Consider implementing a multi-environment promotion strategy

Remember to update your workflow as your application evolves and your deployment needs change.
